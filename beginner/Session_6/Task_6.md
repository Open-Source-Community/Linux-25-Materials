# Task 6: Unpack and Assign

## Task Submission Guidelines

0. **If you haven't already**, [set up your task repository](https://discord.com/channels/885136114275459102/892738283434541076/1314261230252462092). 
1. Copy the file named`Task_6.tar.bz2` **to your task repo**.
2. Extract it to generate a folder named `Task_6/`. 
3. Inside `Task_6/`, create a file named `commands.sh`.
4. Read and follow the instructions found in `Task_6/README.md`. 

   - **NOTE:** You can install and use `mdcat` instead of `cat` for better formatting in the terminal.

5. Write all the commands you use **from point no. 4** in `commands.sh`. Ensure:

   - Each command is correct and can replicate your solution when executed.
   - Any non-command information is written as **comments** (start comments with `#`).

   Example:

   ```bash
   # I am a bash comment. I will not be executed
   echo "hello" # I am another comment
   ```

6. Once done:
   - Add and commit your `commands.sh` file to your task repo using a clear commit message (e.g., `"Added Task 6 solution"`).
   - Push your changes to GitHub using `git push`.
